			<p id="first">So, you'd like to know more about me? I'm a writer, front end web developer and adventure seeker from Seattle. I'm also a professional Irish dancer - true story - and emerging techie. I have a degree in Sociology from The University of British Columbia, and love to communicate with clients about how to make their projects accessable, enjoyable and clear.</p>
			<p id="second">The explorer in me has given me countless opportunities that contribute to my experiences as a writer, deigner and human. I've worked as a Park Ranger, Kayak Guide, Dancer, Camp Counselor and Pedi-Cab Driver. I've managed small and large teams in multiple settings and worked as a freelancer, artist in residence and in several school districts. I've lived in Yellowstone National Park, Ketchikan, Alaska, Vancouver, British Columbia and, of course, Seattle.</p>
			<p id="third">Find out more about my writing, or check out some of my web design. I am available for different types of projects, but love combining my copy writing experience with my skills in webdesign, which could give you a fully functional website. Interested in getting to know me even better? Read my blog, where I write about all sorts of things.</p>
