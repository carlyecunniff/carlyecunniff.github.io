			<h3>Lifestyle Writing</h3>
				<p>As a dancer, maintaining a healthy lifestyle has always been at the forefront of my experience. As I switch gears from a professional mover to a writer and designer, writing lifestyle articles has become even more important.

			<h3>Business Writing</h3>
			<p>I started my own small business three years ago, and never looked back! It is hard work, and making a company successful takes a skill set that I'm certainly still developing. Aside from running my own small business, I've worked for several companies and have plenty of experience writing articles for business owners and entreprenuers.
